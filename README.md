# Human Friendly Id

This is very WIP and currently just for fun. Probably do not try and use this for anything.

This project is inspired by [human-id](https://www.npmjs.com/package/human-id) which you should use instead.

I wanted to make my own version that is the same thing but with only words I love and a little bit more jokey

If you want to contribute friendly words, that would be grand :)
